    <h1>O Beloved: A Dirge of Separation</h1>
    <div class="poem">
O beloved, come reside in my presence—  
my soul has never known such separation.  

O beloved, meet me in my dreams,  
where hopes still dare to come true.  

Since you’ve been gone, my happiness departed too—  
along with my dreams, my hopes, my ambitions, my beliefs.  

You are my life, my joy, my love, my every thought.  
Even my prayers feel incomplete  
if I do not whisper your name.  

O beloved, the nights have grown long,  
and the light of day turned dark.  

The warmth of your smile once comforted me—  
without it, my body is left cold.  

If I could explain how this heart feels,  
my words wouldn’t cover its meaning.  

O beloved, this separation has left me  
longing for your return.  

You are my smile, my happiness,  
my peace in absence.  

It’s not my eyes that sought you,  
but my heart that has known you.  

How do I repair this ache—  
of not being in your company?  

I’ve lied to my heart.  
The longing for your presence  
has driven me insane.  

A poem cannot confine my uneasy soul.  
The presence of your existence  
is long yearned for.  

Since my beloved left,  
my nerves twitch,  
and my body trembles.  

Unto what have I done  
for punishment to be a close friend of mine?  

O beloved, a day may come  
where our bodies meet—  
but I hope yours remembers my company,  
for mine has faded  
ever since your separation.  

I swear by the smile on my beloved’s face—  
without them, time has set to seize.  

O beloved, upon my passing,  
clench my fist with a flower you favor.  

If death do us part,  
the only feeling I’d have forever  
is something my beloved has loved.
